      <p>A photographic essay taking as its starting point the boundary of the Cotswolds AONB, the largest of the UK's Areas Of Outstanding Natural Beauty, designated 1966 and expanded 1990, as it skirts the perimeter of Stroud town, Thrupp and Brimscombe. Running along footpaths, roads and parish boundaries, and marked on the AONB's interactive official map as an unbroken thick red line, the actual margin turns out to be a variegated interzone cluttered with rural-urban motifs which challenge long-standing conventions of beauty and the sublime: untrimmed hedgerows, collapsed fences, walled-off private gardens, knotted tree stumps, angled telephone poles, the glistening steel tracery of the Cheltenham-Paddington railway.</p>
